# Boat-Detection
# Abstract
For an object detection task, one of the fastest way is to use neural network or deep neural
network. These systems can fastly predict the input with high accuracy. After training a network
to classify the boat or non boat sections, we need to use an image as input and implement the
selective search algorithm to find some regions of interests. These regions propably can include a
boat inside. We need to feed these propable regions to the trained network and predict if there is
a boat or not. In addition, before using the selective search, we need to apply some preprocessing
on the image to get better regions. These preprocessing steps could be erosion and dilation,
noise filtering, sharpening image and resizing. To evaluate our job, we need to use a evaluation
function such as intersection over unions or briefly IoU."\n"
